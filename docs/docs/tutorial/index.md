# Slicknode GraphQL Tutorial

## Introduction

This is a step by step tutorial to guide you through the process of building a production-ready GraphQL API 
for a real world application using Slicknode. Afterwards you will have a thorough understanding of how 
to build complex applications while using all the major concepts like authorization, authentication, 
data modeling and creating your own extensions with TypeScript etc. 


## Required Knowledge

Slicknode makes it easy to build complex applications with very limited knowledge. While it is certainly helpful 
to have a basic understanding of computer programming, this is not necessarily required. You should only be 
comfortable using the command line. 

Advanced developers can just follow the instructions and skip the sections with the detailed explanations.
